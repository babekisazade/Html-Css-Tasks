            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the
                capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[10][11]
                He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José
                Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[12] His great-grandmother on his father's
                side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[13] He has one older brother,
                Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[14] He was named after actor and U.S.
                President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[15] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort
                him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor
                refused to perform the procedure,[16][17] as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time.[18]
                Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.</p>
